- For **Android** users, the export option will prompt you to share the image, to save it locally you can save it to an app that saves the image when you share it to the app, some examples include
    - **Files**, If your device allows you to share to **Files**, then this is the best option.
    - [Save Copy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.rikka.savecopy&pcampaignid=web_share), works for me, this one is the one I am personally using on my tablet, since it won't give me the option to use **Files** but your mileage may vary.
    - [Save To*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.xa1.safeto&pcampaignid=web_share), For some reason it tries to rename the image to *.jpg.
    - [Google Photos*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos&pcampaignid=web_share), with the caveat it will compress the final image if you have that option enabled, so either disable compression or use another option.
    - Your E-mail client, yes you can e-mail yourself the result, wonky but works.
    - ??? If you have a suggestion please let me know.
